# 👋&nbsp;Welcome to the GopherFit dev team!
We at ADC are super stoked you're here with us to develop our new in-house app. To get us started, we selected some reading to introduce you to front-end concepts we'll be touching back on along the development process.

#### Don't worry about memorizing any of this information right now!

This material is just so you can get a feel for how everything we'll be using works and ties together, and we expect you to refer back to the material and ask the officers whenever you have any questions on it. Please tick the boxes as you progress through the reading tasks!

- [x] Onboarding: join the team! 🎉

### ⚛️&nbsp;React Native 0.81 Docs
The following are the essential of React Native, the framework we'll be using throughout the entire development process so it's **really important** that you read and understand these thoroughly.
- [ ] [The Basics - *all*](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)
- [ ] [Workflow - Using TypeScript](https://reactnative.dev/docs/typescript)
- [ ] [UI & Interaction - main pages](https://reactnative.dev/docs/style) (_Feel free to skim the Interaction, Connectivity, and Inclusion subsections, though!_)
### ⚡&nbsp;Expo SDK 54 Docs
Expo is the environment in which we'll be developing our application. If React Native is the molecule we're trying to synthesize, Expo is our lab. So yeah, it's _kind of a big deal_.
- [ ] [Get Started - Introduction](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/introduction/)
- [ ] [Get Started - Start developing](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/start-developing/) (skimming other pages in this section recommended)
- [ ] [Develop - Development Builds - Introduction](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [ ] [User Interface - Safe areas](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/user-interface/safe-areas/) (also skim the other pages in this section)
### 💨&nbsp;Nativewind Docs
`nativewind` is the library we'll be using to style our React Components. It's pretty good to be familiar with it, but it's mostly just new syntax, so (please) don't go losing sleep over it.
- [ ] [Getting Started - Overview](https://www.nativewind.dev/docs)
- [ ] [Core Concepts - *all*](https://www.nativewind.dev/docs/core-concepts/tailwindcss)
